## The application is way quicker than on the video, i was rendering in the background and thats why its slow smtimes.

### Box Sorter project was a school project of mine

1. Project goal:
- To arrange a a given amount of 2D boxes with a random size in a given space.
- The deadline was under 2 weeks.

2. Project success
- The project has reached its goal and has been made under a week.
- Im quite happy with how it turned out and that i could visualize the process.

Feel free to steal my code.
